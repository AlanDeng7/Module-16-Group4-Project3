## Project Description
Module 16 is project #3 of the UofT Data Analysis bootcamp. We, as a group, got curious to know if the world happiness index rankings and score have any cause-effect relationship with the factors of population, spending on education as a percentage of GDP and the global migration movement. Therefore, we decided to take up this project and create a dashboard of the abovementioned factors. 

## About
We sourced the 'World Happiness Index' data from Kaggle for 2015-2021, the migration data from the UN's website for 2015 and 2020 and Population Data (2015-2021) and Education Expenditure data (2015-2020) from Our World In Data.

We housed the data using SQL and filtered the data with the columns we needed for visualizations. After sourcing the CSVs from SQL, we worked on Jupyter Notebook to clean the data and merge the datasets on Country Names.

We then used JavaScript, CSS and HTML codes to prepare our dashboards.

You can view the final dashboards above, which include the following:
* Heat Map - World Happiness Score
* Age Distribution Amongst Top 10 and Bottom 10 Happiest Scoring CountrieS
* Countries with the Highest and Lowest Government Spending on Education (% of Country's GDP) 
* Migration Movement Comparisons
* Migration Movement World Heat Map
